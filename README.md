### Austin-Redis-Meetup - Resque Demo

> Our discussion today will revolve around [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque), a [Redis](http://redis.io/) backed job queuing system. 

Running code asynchronously is a sure fire way to ensure that your web server(s) don't crash if bombarded with a sudden influx of traffic. 
When the amount of shoppers in a grocery store increase, the store doesn't hire more employees, the shoppers just get in line and wait till they are served.
In a traditional client server model, requests are processed and served in real time, some of which could be deferred or run in the background.

For instance: Lets say you wanted to build a simple checkout process for an online store. Here are some of the steps you are likely to take in your code.
- Insert into the ```order``` table, create a record, generate an ```orderId```
- Insert into the ```order_product``` table and create several records per item that was purchased
- Pass the order (cart) data to a template that is responsible for generating a receipt
- Show the receipt on the confirmation page
- Grab the receipt HTML and embed it in an email
- Send out the email to the user
- Make an API call to an internal API to record the sale in a legacy ERP system
- Decrease inventory in the ERP system making yet another API call

If you didn't have a way to run code in the background, you would be forced to send the email and make the API calls in real time. 
If you did, you could defer those tasks to run asynchronously, as they don't directly impact data that the user needs to complete her experience.

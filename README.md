### What is Resque?

>Redis-backed library for creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later.
>Background jobs can be any Ruby/PHP class or module that responds to ```perform()```.
>Your existing classes can easily be converted to background jobs or you can create new classes specifically to do work. Or, you can do both.
